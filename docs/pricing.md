## Pricing FAQ

**Q: Why two tiers instead of one?**
A: The old $950/month unlimited model was too expensive for small organizations. Now everyone can afford professional monitoring. Starter covers most small deployments; Unlimited is there when you need it.

**Q: Is $50/year really enough for a business?**
A: Yes. Up to 100 devices, all features, real support. We'd rather have 1,000 customers at $50 than 10 customers at $950/month. Volume makes this work.

**Q: What if I have 101 devices?**
A: You'll need the Unlimited tier at $950/year. Or remove a few devices and stay on Starter. Either way, it's affordable.

**Q: What happens at 5,000 devices?**
A: Contact us and we'll unlock higher limits for free if your use case is legitimate. The cap exists to prevent abuse, not to limit genuine customers.

**Q: Why annual billing only?**
A: At $50/year, monthly billing would be $4.17/month - not worth the overhead. Annual keeps it simple and reduces churn.

**Q: Do you offer education/non-profit discounts?**
A: No longer needed. At $50/year Starter and $950/year Unlimited, we're already affordable for everyone. The old discounts were for the $950/month model.

**Q: How does the Partner Program work?**
A: Register as a partner, declare each customer, pay 50% of retail. $25/customer/year for Starter, $475/customer/year for Unlimited. No minimum, no negotiations.

**Q: Can I pool devices across customers as an MSP?**
A: No. Each customer needs their own subscription. This is fairer for everyone and prevents abuse.

**Q: What counts as a "device"?**
A: Any monitored endpoint: servers, switches, routers, printers, IoT devices, VMs. If our agent can discover it and you want to monitor it, it's a device.

**Q: Is there a contract?**
A: No contracts. Annual billing is pre-paid, cancel anytime with access until the end of your paid period.
